## Description
 The purpose of this lab is to learn how to perform network packet analysis in order to get more intel about the hidden network infrastructure, detect misconfigurations, and most importantly, how you can make use of this intel to get access to systems and escalate your privileges. 
## Enumeration
 We started by scanning using `nmap`.
 nmap result:
 ```bash
 PORT   STATE    SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp filtered ftp
22/tcp open     ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 4f:d3:06:c9:29:81:07:68:3a:c1:2b:49:12:39:c6:19 (RSA)
|   256 f8:fe:33:8d:d9:d5:97:3b:14:08:18:10:4f:3a:19:5c (ECDSA)
|_  256 c2:d5:c2:60:62:0d:cd:a9:83:01:92:b6:dd:be:d6:a2 (ED25519)
80/tcp open     http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```
Port 21 filtered means that the port is being blocked by a firewall.
Using `knock` we can allow connection to port 22. 
```knock works by requiring connection attempts to a series of predefined closed ports. With a simple port knocking method, when the correct sequence of port "knocks" (connection attempts) is received, the firewall opens certain port(s) to allow a connection.```
after that, we can use firewall-bypass script in nmap.

	nmap --script firewall-bypass -p 21 [IP]
nmap result after bypassing the firewall:
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-syst:

We can log in into FTP anonymously:
